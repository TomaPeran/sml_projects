## Rules

One game consists of three rounds, played by four players. The current player spins the wheel and plays for the obtained value (value features). The player can enter a letter or a whole word.

### Game Mechanics

- If the letter exists in the phrase, it will appear in the corresponding places, and the player is awarded a value multiplied by the number of matched places. The turn goes to the next player.
- If the player has a joker, they can choose a vowel, which costs one joker.
- If the player guesses the phrase correctly, their value is multiplied by 10, and the turn goes to the next player.

- If the letter does not exist or the phrase is incorrect, the player loses their turn.
- Players try to guess the phrase, and the winner is the one with the most points at the end of three rounds.

### Value Features

Below is a brief explanation of the possible values on the wheel and their actions:

- **BANKRUPT** -> The player loses their turn. If the player has a joker and wants to use it, they spin the wheel again and lose one joker.
- **Number** -> The player plays for the value of the number.
- **JOKER** -> The playerâ€™s number of jokers increases, and they spin again.
