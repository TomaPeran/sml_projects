# About sml_projects

The Small Projects repository (sml_projects) serves as a showcase for my work as a college student. While the collection is currently modest and filled with straightforward projects, it represents the foundation of my learning journey. My goal is to gradually expand this repository with a diverse range of projects, some simple while others more complex and practical.
As I continue to grow in my skills and knowledge, I aim to include all kinds of applications that reflect my evolving interests and expertise. This repository is not just a reflection of my current capabilities, it is also a commitment to continuous improvement.
