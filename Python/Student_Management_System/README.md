# Student Management System

The Student Management System project aims to create a user-friendly platform that simplifies the processes of student enrollment, course management, and overall education management. This type of management system is essential for maintaining organized documentation, ensuring that student records, academic performance, and course information are easily accessible and efficiently managed.

## User Story
In user management application it is crutial to have login and registration page so only staff is allowed to enter. This type of student management system will have three types of user: Administrator, Professor and of course Student.


### Student
As a student, my only concern in the school year is to enroll in the subjects that interest me, also the ones I really need to. So of course I need to be able to enroll and unenroll from the subjects. Sure enough there should be a dedicated page for all my subjects, displaying key information such as course names, ECTS. Also it would be nice if I could see which professor holds which subject. By default all subjects are in 'Not Enroleld' state and I can enroll and unenroll any time I want except when subject status is 'Lost Signature' or 'Passed'.

### Professor
As a professor I am working really hard with students and all of this documentation is just too much, it would be nice if it was all organised. So I would like to have a page with all of my subjects informations and a special button next to a subject that will show me all students enrolled in my subject. Finally my job as a professor is to pass a student based on his commitment and will to pass the subject, so I need a page to change students grade from 'Enrolled' to 'Passed' or 'Lost Signature'.

### Administrator
So as an Administrator (or Admin) I am kinda special type of user, I am responsible for managing the system. I am so powerful that I can see every enrollment information, every information about subject or system user. From seeing all students being enrolled to a subject, to having acces to all enrollments in a system and even giving authority to professor over one of a subjects. Of course I am also able to create, delete or even modify every subject, user and even enrollment form. But with great power comes great responsibility, so to be sure that I won't delete something and then regret it, I MUST HAVE a pop up to confirm my deletion.
